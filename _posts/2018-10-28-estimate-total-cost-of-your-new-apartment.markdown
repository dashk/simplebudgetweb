## Motivation
I recently just finished my apartment hunting in the DC area. While this is not
the first time I look for a place, the landscape has changed in the sense that
it is now a common practice for property management to charge tenants fees on
top of the usual application & monthly rent.

Couple examples:
* Monthly parking fee (Even for an unreserved parking spot)
* Trash
* Monthly/yearly ammenities/facilities fee you are required to pay (Even if you
  don't use their gym at all)
* Elevator reservation fee during move-in/out

To make things complicated, property management may also waive/offer discount
on some of the fees in attempts to make the offer appealing.

What this boils down to is: Even if the rent is $2000 on paper, that's not
necessarily the true rent you'll be paying every month.

Being frustrated by this, I created a simple tool (Google Sheet) to help me
evaluate offers between different places. If you are hunting for your next
apartment, hope this tool would help you navigate the different offers you have
as well.

## tool
Here is a link to the Google Sheet.

## The process
### Gather information

### Plug in the numbers

## Making a decision
Numbers aren't always everything - It's mostly about how much you are willing
to pay based on the experience you'll get in return.

## How I used it

## Summary
Hope you liked the tool. Should you have questions, feel free to ping me at
