# Who are you?
Hi there, I am Kenny.

# What do you do?
I am a practicing minimalist, who happens to be a software engineer during the
day.

# How did you get into budgeting?
As a minimalist, I often ask what I could do to live more simply. Eliminating
the non-essentials from life have always been part of my weekly routine.

Looking at where my money tells me:
* Understand what I value
* Identity patterns that lead to wastes (Remember that shirt you got from
  Lululemon that you never wear again?)

Budgeting happens to be an effective way to achieve the 2 objectives above.

# What are your philosophy around budgeting?
It isn't so much about living cheaply, but rather focusing your resources on
what you value the most: It could be a great vacation, or achieving financial
freedom by mid-40s.

# What are your favorite budgeting tools?
I have yet to discover *the* perfect tool to do budgeting, but here are a
couple I used frequently:

* [YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=DsOsip2qQyKYrmop&utm_source=customer_referral)
* [Mint by Intuit](https://www.intuit.com)
